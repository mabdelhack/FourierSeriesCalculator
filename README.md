# FourierSeriesCalculator

## Description
It is an old project from 2009 for my C/C++ programming class in Electrical Engineering department, Alexandria University, Egypt.

## Features
- The program takes an input function and parses the entries to then calculate their Fourier series expansion.
- It can accept multiple intervals
- It can calculate the expansion for constant, polynomial, exponential, sine, and cosine functions and their additive combinations
- It uses Simpson's numerical integration to compute the Fourier series expansion
